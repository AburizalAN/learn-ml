        "Let's use an analogy for agent in LangChain, it's much easier to understand. Think of an agent as a person. Let's use a bank cashier as an example. A bank cashier can accept deposit from a customer, count the money, input the deposit amount along with customer data into the banking system and provide receipt to the customer. Now, if counterfeit money is found, then the cashier can reject the deposit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, an agent is an autonomous entities capable of performing tasks and making decisions. It can interact with it's environment, process information, and execute actions. The actions of agents are based on predefined rules or learned behavior, allowing them to adapt to different situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's call this bank cashier as cashier agent. Now we want this cashier agent to also handle customer complaints. Can this agent do that ? Yes it can, but, and I must emphasize \"but\" here, it will be doing two things that are unrelated, making it overly complicated. In this case we usually create a new agent to handle the customer complaints. So there can be multiple agents at work in the same system.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's not complicated you say ? Hmm... customer complaints are regularly updated because there can be new rules introduced by the bank that makes the old answer no longer valid or there are new kind of customer complaints due to a new product being introduced. I think it's better to split the agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus it's important to think of agents in the context of the goal for the agent and tasks performed by the agent.\n",
        "\n",

And agents also play a crucial role in creating sophisticated AI applications with Lang Chain, enabling autonomous and intelligent operations."
