        "## What is Prompt in AI Language Models?\n",
        "\n",
        "A prompt is like a clue given to an AI model. This clue helps the AI know what to talk about. It's like asking a question or starting a conversation. The AI takes this clue and uses it to come up with a response. The clue can be a question, a sentence, or even just one word. It's very important because it tells the AI what to say next. It's the first step that guides the AI's answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of an AI language model as a super-smart parrot. This parrot doesn't know what to say until you give it a hint, which we call a `prompt`.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if you say to the parrot,\n",
        "\n",
        "`Tell me a story about a brave knight`\n",
        "\n",
        "The parrot (or AI model) then uses this prompt to create a story about a brave knight.\n",

        "The prompt is important because it sets the direction for what the AI model will generate.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's like giving a topic for an essay to a student. The student uses that topic to write an essay. Similarly, the AI model uses the prompt to generate a response.\n",
        "\n",

For instance, you might want to use a lower temperature for tasks like fact-based Q&A to promote more accurate and to the point responses.

        "\n",
        "3. **Input Data**\n",
        "\n",
        "   Input data is the information that the AI model processes to accomplish the task set in the prompt. In our example, the input data is:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
